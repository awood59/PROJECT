This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
# As the Enrollment and Drop Out Rate datasets both had district codes, merge via "District Code"
DropOutData <- merge(DropOut, Enrollment, by="District Code")
```

```{r}
# As the Financials and the new datasets both had district codes, merge via "District Name"
FullData <- merge(WAFinance1, DropOutData, by="District Name")
```

```{r}
# Now we can take a look at the data frame variable.
str(FullData)
```
```{r}
summary(FullData)
```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
