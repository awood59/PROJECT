This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
compressedMap= 'https://github.com/awood59/PROJECT/raw/master/tl_2013_53_unsd.zip'
```

```{r}
library(utils)
temp=tempfile()
download.file(compressedMap, temp)
unzip(temp)
```

```{r}
(maps=list.files(pattern = 'shp'))
```

```{r}
library(rgdal)
wazipMap <- rgdal::readOGR("tl_2013_53_unsd.shp",stringsAsFactors=F)
```

```{r}
plot(wazipMap,col='pink')
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
