This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 



```{r}
temp = tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx") # use always with Excel
dataURL <- "https://github.com/awood59/data/raw/gh-pages/Grads2015.xlsx" 
download.file(dataURL, destfile=temp, mode='wb')
# now get it:
Grad = read_excel(temp, sheet =1)
head(Grad,2)
```

```{r}
temp = tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx") # use always with Excel
dataURL <- "https://github.com/awood59/data/raw/gh-pages/EnrollmentWA.xlsx" # link to data
download.file(dataURL, destfile=temp, mode='wb')
# now get it:
Enrollment = read_excel(temp, sheet =1)
head(Enrollment,2)
```
```{r}
FinanceLink='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/awood59/data/gh-pages/SchoolFinanceEdit.csv' # link to data

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
